1. Environment variables
NUM_NODES: number of VMs and hence OVS instances in the test environment. Typical is 6, minimum is 3.
ODL: IP Address of OpenDaylight Controller. 
SUBNET: Subnet to use for VMs. "xxx.xxx.xxx.", expected to be /24.

2. Uses Vagrant 1.4.3 and VirtualBox.

3. Usage.
- Set env vars, "vagrant up". This will take a long time.
- vi utils/hosts if SUBNET changed. ./setuphosts.sh
- ./startdemo.sh : kicks off VMs and assigns them "types" as per "infrastructure_config.py"
- ./cleandemo.sh : cleans up demo
- Requires POSTMAN files (TBD) to provision.

4. GBP GUI
- accessed at http://<controller>:8181/index.html

5. Controller must use following featuers:

"feature:install odl-groupbasedpolicy-ofoverlay odl-groupbasedpolicy-ui odl-restconf"

Features coming soon:
- Auto configuration instead of POSTMAN
- SF and use-cases instead of demo
